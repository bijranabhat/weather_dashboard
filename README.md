This is a simple weather-based interactive dashboard application designed in Vue.js framework.
This application relies on Google Maps API for extracting the geolocation data and uses Dark Sky API 
for pulling the latest Weather data

The application shows:
  Details of the location for which the users want to see the weather, along with some primary information about the weather.
  Graphical information about the weather of Users location of interest, such as:
      Temperature variation for the day of query
      Highlights of todayâ€™s weather:
      Wind Speed and Direction
      Visibility
      UV Index
      
 I found a nice article on medium about the use of Fusion charts and followed a tutorial by Souvik Sarkar to design this application.
